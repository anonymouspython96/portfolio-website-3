Interactive To-Do List Documentation
Here is the detailed documentation for the to-do list application you just created, explaining its structure, functionality, and interactions.

Application Overview
This application is a single-page interactive to-do list designed to help you manage your daily tasks. The main goal is to provide a clean and intuitive interface that allows you to easily add, complete, delete, and filter tasks, while keeping them saved in your browser.

The minimalist design, built with the Tailwind CSS framework, ensures optimal viewing on devices of all sizes. The entire code, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, is contained in a single file for simplicity and immediate use.

Key Features
Adding Tasks: You can add new tasks by typing text into the input field and clicking the "Add" button. Tasks are added to the top of the list.

Task Status: Each task has a checkbox. By clicking it, you can mark the task as completed. Completed tasks are displayed with a strikethrough text effect, making them easy to identify.

Filtering: At the bottom of the list, there are three buttons to filter your tasks:

All: Displays all tasks, both active and completed.

Active: Shows only the tasks that have not yet been completed.

Completed: Displays only the tasks you have marked as complete.

Task Count: A counter below the list shows the number of tasks still left to complete.

Deleting Tasks:

Single Deletion: When you hover over a task, a trash can icon appears. By clicking it, you can permanently delete that task.

Bulk Deletion: The "Clear Completed" button removes all tasks you have marked as completed, helping you keep your list clean and organized.

Persistent Storage: The application uses the browser's localStorage to save your tasks. This means your list will remain intact even if you close or refresh the page.

Structure and Implementation
The application consists of a single HTML page (todo_app.html). The user interface is defined in the document body, while the logic is entirely handled by an integrated JavaScript code block.

HTML: The HTML structure includes a header with the title and current date, a form for adding tasks, an unordered list (<ul>) to display the tasks, and a footer with controls for filtering and deletion.

CSS: Layout and styling are managed by Tailwind CSS, loaded via a CDN. Some custom CSS rules were also added to handle the completed state, the visibility of the delete button, and the style of the checkbox.

JavaScript: The main logic is within the script. When the page loads, the code:

Loads tasks saved in localStorage.

Sets up event listeners for adding, deleting, and changing the state of tasks.

Manages the functions to render the list, update the count, and filter tasks based on user interaction.
